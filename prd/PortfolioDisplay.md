You need to implement the feature to display portfolio in the PortfolioExplorer.
- Introduce a new top level node called Portfolio.
- Under the Portfolio node, display each asset as a separate node using its name.
- The Portfolio information should be read from the portfolio.json file under current workspace folder.
- A sample portfolio.json is provided.
- All asset nodes should use the "package" icon consistently.
- Display the asset type (simple, investment, composite, stock) as the description for each asset node.
