# Feature Description
- Support adding/removing tags in the assetDefinitionEditor webview
    - Can add free text tag by allowing user to input a tag
    - Can add a tag by selecting from a full tag list. The full tag list is generated by extract all the distinct tags from all assets.
    - Can remove an existing tag.
    - The add/remove tag features needs to be implemented inline in the asset editor instead of doing any pop-ups.
    - The tags needs to be saved into the portfolio.json. An example is provided in tags.sample.portfolio.json

# Design Hints
- Implement the tags list by following the example of how assetPage loads all assets for transfer's dropdown.
    - The tags list is always retrieved from backend (extension / typescript code).
    - Communicates by using postMessage
- Introduce a new class called PortfolioDataAccess which plays the role of bridging between the on-disk store (PortfolioStore and related XXXData interfaces) and the in-memory structures (like Asset). 
    - Implement the getAllTags in this class. 
    - Cache the result of the distinct tag list in this class.
    - Introduce event between PortfolioDataAccess and PortfolioStore so that whenever portfolio.json is updated, invalidate the caches in the PortfolioDataAccess.
    - Remove the asset cache in the PortfolioExplorerProvider and make it rely on PortfolioDataAccess. Maintain the asset cache in PortfolioDataAccess.
